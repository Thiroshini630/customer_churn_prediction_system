#  Customer Churn Prediction System

##  Overview
The Customer Churn Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based solution designed to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue a service. 

Customer churn is a major challenge in industries such as telecom, banking, retail, and subscription-based services. This project helps businesses identify high-risk customers and take proactive retention measures to reduce revenue loss.

---

##  Problem Statement
Organizations often lose customers due to lack of early detection of churn behavior. Traditional analysis methods are reactive and time-consuming.

This system provides a predictive, data-driven approach to identify churn risk in advance.

---

##  Solution Approach
The system uses supervised machine learning techniques to:

- Analyze customer behavioral data
- Train a classification model
- Predict churn probability
- Evaluate performance using accuracy and classification metrics

A Logistic Regression classifier is implemented to classify customers into:
- Churn (Likely to leave)
- Non-Churn (Likely to stay)
